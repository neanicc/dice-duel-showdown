# Description: This program is a 1v1 game between player vs CPU. The overall
# goal of this game is to beat the other player via getting the closest to 50
# points. If the user or the CPU gets 50 points, they win the game. If both
# user and CPU get the same points, it's a tie. If they get over 50 points,
# then they bust / lose the game. If both the player and the CPU get below 50
# points, the closest to 50 wins the game. This game lasts 10 turns featuring
# two special rules. One being that if a party rolls two of the same value
# they opposite part losses 10 points. The second special rule consists
# of skipping a turn: If the user has over 40 points, they can skip a turn
# but have only two skips. However, the computer has a 30% chance to skip
# their turn when over 40 points, but has unlimited skips. This description/
# guide is also said in our howToPlay() function and our research file!

# Purpose: The purpose of the program is to give the user a chance to think
# about how a computer plays and make decisions based on that. The first few
# parts of the game the user has a chance to analyze the computer rolls, their
# rolls, and how the special rule would help or hurt their chances of winning.
# The final part (after the parties are at 40 points and can use skips) gives
# the user the ability to critically think of how the skips can benefit them
# or can obstruct their chances of winning. After a few rounds of playing, the
# user learns how the game works and how they can strategize & analyze to win.
# Have fun!

In this game, your goal is to roll two dice and get the closest to 50 points \
\nwithin 10 turns without going over 50 points. While you are rolling, you are \
\ncompeting against a computer. If either you or the computer rolls the same \
\nnumber twice (eg. roll a 5 and 5, or 6 and 6, etc), the opposite player will \
\nlose 10 points. If you have more than 40 points, you will have 2 skips where \
\nyou can skip your roll if you choose to. If the computer is over 40 points, \
\nthey have a 30% chance of skipping their turn, and have infinite skips. If \
\nyou go over 50 points, the computer will automatically win, and if the \
\ncomputer goes over 50 points, you will automatically win. In case there is \
no \nwinner after the 10 turns, the party with the most points will be \
victorious \n(same points is a tie). If a party hits exactly 50 points, \
they will \nautomatically win. \n\nGood luck and have fun! \n"
